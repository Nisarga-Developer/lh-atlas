# LibreHealth Atlas

The Atlas is a mini project which displays user data from the EHR, Radiology and Toolkit projects. The primary aim is for it to be used as a support page, where new users can look for fellow users in their neighbourhood and request help and support.

The Atlas is built using the Google Maps JavaScript API, and the backend is temporarily provided by Firebase.

## Using the Atlas

A demo of the Atlas is available at: https://vishwas-adiga.github.io/lh-atlas/index.html
